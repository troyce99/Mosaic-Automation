"""
Read from a controller IO port.

Usage: dominh [--no-upload] read [options] <host> <port_type> <index>

Options:
  -h --help     Show this screen.
  --status      Change program exit status according to IO value:
                 OFF : exit status 0
                 ON  : exit status 1
                Note: this is only supported for port types that
                map to boolean values.
